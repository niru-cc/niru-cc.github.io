/* I organised the questions and answers into left and right classes so I could align them similar to how the Concert Hall site arranges its text, even without corresponding images. I figured this would be good to try with flexbox, which is why I chose that as the display mode. I still wanted the boxes to go downwards so I switched it to column. In the end, all the boxes looked spaced out but still clear.*/
