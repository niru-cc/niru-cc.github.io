      <h3>
        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The bottom half of the initial screen, where it reads “Sculpting
        Harmony”. The text is in a bold font and covers half the screen. The
        letters move, shrinking and growing according to the position of the
        mouse. Furthermore, when the mouse is moved over this section, it leaves
        a trail of smaller white text of Frank Gehry’s comments on the Walt
        Disney Concert Hall. The animation and trailing text is what drew my
        eyes to this section of the screen.

    <div>
      <h3>
        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        All the sections with the option to look at the 3D models- these were
        the more interactive parts of the website, since you could move and
        rotate the models, as well as look at the notes that have been attached
        to them. They are also accessed in the video segments of the exhibit
        that they are connected to, so people are able to pause the video and
        look at the objects being talked about for themselves.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>
        What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
        experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The way this site presents information makes scrolling a more
        interactive action in comparison to regular sites. Because it is meant
        to be a linear experience, they make it more interactive by having
        moving parts that respond to scrolling in more visually interesting
        ways. This is done in order to give viewers the impression that they are
        progressing through an exhibit. For example, this site has sections
        where blocks of text move along and stretch and squish with the
        scrolling.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>What is the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this site is to promote and educate people about the
      Walt Disney Concert Hall. The information presented comes in the forms of
      text, videos and interactive models, all ordered to create a narrative
      about the creation of the Concert Hall in a manner similar to a museum
      exhibit.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h3>
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Scrolling and seeing how the text and background colours move by- making
        scrolling through a single linear page the main way of progressing just
        like on any other site means people will understand what to do, and
        adding an additional bit of interaction through giving people the
        ability to play with the 3D models and view the notes attached to them
        keeps them interested along the way. As the site garners interest in the
        Concert Hall, there may be people that want to review specific pieces of
        information from this site, made easier with a chapter select menu.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>
        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This site is primarily designed to be visited one time. It is a long,
        linear experience with multiple videos and interactive segments, and
        does not get any updates or changes over time. It's possible to quit at
        certain points and easily go back to them, as long as you remember where
        you left off, but overall the main experience this site was made with in
        mind is a single run through the page.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>
        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        People are still able to revisit the site if they quit midway, or if
        they are someone like a student, need to review particular information.
        This was done by adding chapters and sectioning their videos to make it
        easier to navigate and skip through to specific areas. However, the site
        is still just meant to be one long interactive exhibit, so it does not
        save or track progress, and does not get updated, and so there is only a
        limited amount of information people can revisit this site for.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>
        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The way this site is built is as an exhibition. Therefore there are
        things to look at with information attached, with an option for people
        to do further reading on the site if they felt like it, as well as the
        3D models as interactive features. The written sections are in small
        paragraphs in wide open spaces exactly like a real museum. Exhibitions
        are set up with the user’s experience in mind, so the page is set up in
        a very linear way to help curate the experience and adds fitting
        background music that adds to the atmosphere.

      <h3>
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        As an exhibit, it encourages people experiencing it for the first time
        to look through the whole thing in a straight line. There are no
        branching paths, but there are places to stay on- for example, sections
        with videos and models, or sections with a "read more" option. The index
        also provides extra images related to the creation of the Concert Hall
        for those who want to see more. People aren't forced to stick around for
        these sections, but they can if tehy want to, much like in a physical
        exhibition.

      <p>
        This site is created to be an educational resource and is modelled based
        on real life museum exhibitions, so it aims to make people curious about
        the Concert Hall. The information is all delivered through interactive
        models, videos and blocks of text separated by giant headers and images,
        all of which help to retain the viewer's attention. Aside from visual
        design, they also use sound in the form of symphony music playing in the
        background to enhance the atmosphere of a refined concert hall.

      <h3>
        What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I found it visually satisfying to watch all the text animations,
        particularly for the chapter header sections and places where they use
        the giant bold font. As you scroll by, the large text stretches and
        squishes according to its position on the screen, similarly to the title
        of the site. Chapter headers have the text arranged to match their
        respective subjects and have pen scribbles in the background that
        respond to the movement of your mouse. Clicking on the menu also has
        this animation where they bring in giant text saying "Chapters", which
        gets squished down by the clickable chapter items. The font and
        animation styles go really well together and makes the page feel a bit
        more fun overall, which is why I like it so much.
