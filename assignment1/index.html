      <h3>
        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The bottom half of the initial screen, where it reads “Sculpting
        Harmony”. The text is in a bold font and covers half the screen. The
        letters move, shrinking and growing according to the position of the
        mouse. Furthermore, when the mouse is moved over this section, it leaves
        a trail of smaller white text of Frank Gehry’s comments on the Walt
        Disney Concert Hall. The interactivity and animation is what drew my
        eyes to this section of the screen.

          or of a pipe organ

          particular section

    <div>
      <h3>
        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        All the sections with the option to look at the 3D models- these were
        the more interactive parts of the website, since you could move and
        rotate the models, as well as look at what notes have been attached to
        them. They are also accessed in the video segments of the exhibit that
        they are connected to, so people are able to pause the video and look at
        the objects being talked about for themselves.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>
        What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
        experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The way this site presents information makes scrolling a more
        interactive action in comparison to regular sites. Because it is meant
        to be a linear experience, they make it more interactive by having
        moving parts that respond to scrolling in more visually interesting
        ways. This is done in order to give viewers the impression that they are
        progressing through an exhibit. For example, this site has sections
        where blocks of text move along and stretch and squish with the
        scrolling.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>What is the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this site is to promote and educate people about the
      Walt Disney Concert Hall. The information presented comes in the forms of
      text, videos and interactive models, all ordered to create a narrative
      about the creation of the Concert Hall in a manner similar to a museum
      exhibit.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h3>
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Scrolling and playing with all the text that moves by- scrolling through
        a single linear page as the main way of progressing just like on any
        other site means people will understand what to do. Adding an additional
        bit of interaction through giving people the ability to play with the 3D
        models and view the notes attached to them keeps them interested along
        the way. As the site garners interest in the Concert Hall, there may be
        people that want to review specific pieces of information from this
        site, made easier with a chapter select menu.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>
        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This site is primarily deisgned to be visited one time. It is a long,
        linear experience with multiple videos and interactive segments. It does
        not get any updates or changes over time. It's possible to quit at
        certain points ad easily go back to them but overall, the main
        experience this site was made with in mind is a single run through the
        site.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>
        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        People are still able to revisit the site if they quit midway, or if
        they are someone like a student, need to review particular information.
        This was done by adding chapters and sectioning their videos to make it
        easier to navigate and skip through to specific areas. However, the site
        is still just meant to be one long interactive exhibit, so it does not
        save or track progress, and does not change, and so there is only a
        limited amount of information people can revisit this site for.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>
        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The way this site is built is as an exhibit in a museum. Therefore there
        are things to look at with information attached, with an option for
        people to read more text if they felt like it. With a bunch of pictures
        included. Also the 3D models. The written sections are in small
        paragraphs in wide open spaces exactly like a real museum Exhibitions
        are set up with the user’s experience in mind- the page is set up in a
        very linear way to help curate the experience and adds fitting
        background music that adds to the atmosphere
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        As an exhibit, it encourages people experiencing it for the first time
        to look through the whole thing in a straight line. Like some exhibits,
        there are no branching paths, but there are some places to stay on- for
        example, sections with videos and models, or sections with a "read more"
        option. The index also provides extra images related to the creation of
        the Concert Hall for those who want to see more.

      </h3>
      <p>
        This site is created to be an educational resource and is modelled based
        on real life museum exhibitions, so it aims to make people curious about
        the Concert Hall. Aside from visual design, they also use sound in the
        form of symphony music playing in the background to enhance the
        atmosphere of a refined concert hall.

      <h3>
        What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Scrolling and watching how all the text moves by in different ways. It
        moves along with pages of colour and simulated pen lines. Visually
        satisfying. Big text squishes much like at the beginning of the page.
